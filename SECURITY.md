## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

我人在台北一直被根本完全不認識的人一直用各種方式欺壓我，然後想透過這個方式對待您們，您們一定要自救。
